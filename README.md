#  About Me

I'm a software developer and I specialize in bitcoin and Android. I've been working on the Bitcoin Development Kit language bindings (Kotlin, Swift, Python) through a Spiral grant and now the BDK Foundation.

I have a blog at [thunderbiscuit.com](https://thunderbiscuit.com). You can reach me on [Twitter](https://x.com/thunderB__).
