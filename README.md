#  About Me

I'm a software developer, and I work on the intersection of bitcoin and Android. I've been working on the Bitcoin Development Kit language bindings (Kotlin, Swift, Python) through a [Spiral grant](https://spiral.xyz/) and now the [BDK Foundation](https://bitcoindevkit.org/foundation/).

I have a blog at [thunderbiscuit.com](https://thunderbiscuit.com). You can reach me on [Twitter](https://x.com/thunderB__).
